Analoga was my first full-time software development job. 
I worked mostly on the front-end during my early months for a side project of the company that provided pixel perfect markup and styles for its customers. 
Later on I moved into Analoga's staff to work on their propertary e-commerce framework, as well as with different technologies when working with their other clients, such as Wordpress and Drupal sites.
