As one of the first hires of Ascentis in Uruguay I got to participate in many of the forming processes of the office in the country.
From interviewing candidates to the development of the career paths for the different profiles and positions within the engineering department, to stablishing and leading the Front End Practice. 
I took many roles in the company as I was able to fill the needs of the department in a lot of aspects: 
- Individual contributor in a Scrum Team, as a Full-stack developer
- Front End Tech Lead from start providing support to many teams in this area.
- Scrum Master for a brief period of time for a particular team.
- Associate DevOPS when working on the build pipelines for some products
- UX Engineer doing a full product design migration & implementation
