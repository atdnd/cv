title: Application Developer - VividCortex | 2013 - 2016
date: 1-1-2013

I worked for the VividCortex startup on the development of it's server and database monitoring application, which will eventually become part of the Solarwinds suite. 
During these years I got to implement many features of the webapp using AngularJS and Symfony, design and develop the first iterations of the corporate website and blog, and ultimately work as an internals tool developer.
Since I was the third employee of the company I had the luck to contribute in many aspects of the product upbringing and to learn and experience the start-up methodologies.
