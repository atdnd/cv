title: CTO - Lexart Labs | 2016 - 2017
date: 1-1-2016

After leaving VividCortex I joined Lexart Labs as a partner and took on the role of CTO.
Lexart Labs was a very small Software Factory at the moment in which I arrived and it was in much need of direction and hard work. 
During my time in Lexart Labs I worked setting the direction and standards for our development team,
built a hiring pipeline to help with the growth of the company in terms of capacity, supervised specific projects and worked as a developer as much as needed. 
This was my first contact with the many expectations of management outside of engineering labor and as such I highly value most of my learnings from this experience.
