I worked for Creart as a Graphic Designer, assisting the Senior Designer in creating marketing assets, billboards, retail store designs, for different stablished brands ranging from food to clothing.
Even though it was mainly focused on printed media, it was in this company where I started working on website development for different advertisement campaigns.
